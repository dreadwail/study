JavaScript: The Good Parts
==========================

These are just my experiments as I went through 'JavaScript: The Good Parts' brushing up on my javascript.

I hand-rolled a really basic test framework to allow me to perform assertions on javascript behavior. The reason I did
this rather than grab an existing test framework was just additional js practice.
