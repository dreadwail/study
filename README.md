## Rust Learning

These are my notes and practice code for learning the Rust programming language.

## Notes

Rust is very C-like in its syntax.

The [Rust book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) tells you to use spaces not tabs. I already do use spaces but this isn't important and shouldn't be present in the book.

Macro's end with a bang(!) while functions do not.

Semicolons turn value expressions into statements which resolve to a 'unit': ().
There is a corner of my brain that is saying this feels very lisp-like but I don't remember enough about lisp to speak intelligently about it.
