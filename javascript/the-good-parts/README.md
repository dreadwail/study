# JavaScript: The Good Parts

These are just my experiments as I went through 'JavaScript: The Good Parts' while brushing up on my javascript.

_PLEASE NOTE: At the time I wrote this I hardly knew any javascript at all. There are lots of problems in here but I haven't bothered to go back and clean it up._

## Additional Notes

I hand-rolled a really basic test framework to allow me to perform assertions on javascript behavior. The reason I did this rather than grab an existing test framework was just additional js practice.

I didn't bother doing chapters 1 and 2 because there just isn't much to them but basic syntax rules. Thus my study/experimentation started at chapter 3.
